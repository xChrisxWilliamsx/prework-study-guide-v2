# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide Website was created to assist in note taking and demo training for the entry into a Full-Stack Coding environment.  The purpose of building this site is to assist in learning basic entry level skills including HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.  We also want to ensure we can track and add notes to this repo throughout the program to build a guide as we learn new items.  This may include future hyperlinks to resources and webpages we find along our learning journey.  Once we learn how to add these into this file, we will create an additional section for those.  This helps us create a solid foundation that we can grow as we continue down the existing path of coding.  During this process We have learned a lot, made a lot of mistakes, and used the in canvas resources and external resources to resolve any concern made in an attempt to help build conditional thinking and problem solving on our own.  We learned how to use basic commands in the CLI, how to use VS code to create a snapshot of the main code on Github on our local device, and how to pull the origin code and push the new updated code to GitHub.  We also learned A few basic functions in HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.  The entry into this Prework Study Guide was very exciting and a bit challenging seeing as I am entering into this with no prior knowledge. I do invite you to view this webpage to see if you learn anything new or practice a skill set you may already have down.  LET'S HONE OUR CRAFT TOGETHER!  Feel free to reach out to me with any critiques and/or any additional information we can add.
